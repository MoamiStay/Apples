        <h2>Introducing: Momis</h2>
        <p>Today I will introduce this little friend. Her name is Little Moamis, just "Momis" for short. She might seem a little strange to some people, but she  is completely harmless. Although she's usually pretty quiet around strangers she can be surprisingly lively when she feels comfortable. No matter how awful it might sound or how funny it looks, she loves to sing, rap and/or dance along to her favorite songs to recharge and release stress.</p>
        <div class="container">
        <img src="images/home/momistrio.png" alt="Little Momis">
      </div>
        <p>She tries to seem tough, but she cries easily. She'll often sob to cheesy romance series or animation films for kids.. </p>
        <p>She typically finds reality a little too tiring and boring, so she will often spend most of her time inside one of the many worlds she has created for herself. </p>
        <p>She knows it is important to take care of oneself and stay healthy. Unfortunately she doesn't like being around too many strangers and she certainly doesn't like doing anything that requires physical effort. So after a day at the gym it's pretty likely she'll need a few hours extra sleep. </p>

            I've been playing this game since it's release on february 4th 2021.
            The amount of hours I spent each day playing this game the first
            week after release was .. well.. questionable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember this song particularly well since it was sooo hard at the
            time. At that point we didn't even have the 5x Speed option, so it
            was even "easier" than in this video.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remeber playing this song (poorly) and only dreaming of ever being
            able to get a perfect score. well, LOOK AT ME NOW!
          </p>
          <p>
            I really don't feel like I've improved that much. At this point it
            doesn't feel like that big of a deal being able to play this song.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's why I wanna leave this video here as a reminder of that...
            Even if you don't feel like it, you are always improving. And before
            you know it, the thing that seemed impossible at one point is now an
            easy feat.

            I made this some time ago, probably late at night all alone in my
            box. It's not something I'm particularly proud of. I just put it
            here as a test for figuring out how to structure this section of my
            website.
