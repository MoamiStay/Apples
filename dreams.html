          <h3>29.12.21</h3>
          <p><em>Kinda cool I guess. 7/10</em></p>
          <p>
            I was on a class trip. I'd say we were roughly 15 people. We arrived
            in a old dusty city, brighly lit by golden light. However there was
            no sun for the desert-like city was buried underground. We climbed
            the stairs up an old brick building on the corner. Inside were beds
            and living facilities for us to use. The room looked as if it had
            been decorated by my dear old grandmother. The pillows and bed
            covers was hand knitted in red, green, black and white square
            patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together with my friends we chatted with old classmates in the
            cafeteria.
          </p>
          <p>A day came when I had to run.</p>
          <p>
            A wicked creature had appeared in the city and was wreaking havoc.
            Now, he was chasing me.
          </p>
          <p>It was hunt or be hunted.</p>
          <p>
            I had to fight back. I raced around the city, dashing, flying almost
            teleporting from one place to another. Moving around was easy thanks
            to the city's railing-hook system. But hunting this creature down
            was no easy task. He knew the city inside-out and disappeared just
            as quikly as he had appeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day the disgusting rat had found my family and threathened to
            hurt them. I needed to hurry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wicked rat was as tall as a man and had aquired a native tounge.
            A unpredictable evil drived by nothing but plain wickedness. Worse
            yet, he could take on the form of nearly any other living creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            He led me an old house in the city. The old couple who lived there
            was killed and and he had taken on the form of the husband in order
            to get a jump on me. I was quick enough to dodge his initial attack.
            Now I had to try and fight him off-

          <p><em>Why am I always fighting everyone?.. 4/10</em></p>
          <p>
            I found myself in a partially rustic city-like area. I was running
            from someone who was out to get me. J was part of the group that
            came for me and nearly killed me. We fought inside a huge old castle
            that was mostly left in ruin. They had me pinned down and used a
            taser to hurt me.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point I had managed to steal the taser and was ready to take
            my revenge. I knew J's mother worked in a convenience store near
            where I lived so I headed there. I knew she wouldn't stirr up any
            trouble in broad daylight so I went there to scare her.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I got there I acted like an ordinary customer and showed her the
            taser, asking if they had any batteries. As I expected she
            recognized both me and the taser. She looked frightened and startled
            by my bold appearance. She tried to take the weapon away from me-

          <p><em>Not a nightmare, but I just felt uneasy. 5/10</em></p>
          <p>
            I was in Australia. It was only me and a instructor standing on the
            long sand beach. I was supposed to learn how to surf. When the
            instructor was out in the ocean I was still standnig on the shore,
            hesitant to enter the water. There was a lot of small sharks, red
            rays and other scary critters lurking in the shallow water.
            Sometimes small sharks would even jump on land.
          </p>
          <p>
            I borrowed a float mattress and eventually found myself floating far
            off in the ocean. The mattress was quite small and I was constantly
            struggling to keep the balance so I wouldn't fall off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back home we lived in small one-room houses in the jungle. I shared
            room with my friend, S. One day there was some commotion taking
            place in one of the nearby houses. A neighbour had a fight with her
            ex. She threw beer bottles at him and their house. Later we talked
            to the girl and she invited us to a sleepover. We talked and got
            along.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the night came and we went to bed I noticed a chameleon and a
            spider crawling in through the window.

          <p><em>Still creeps me out.. 7/10</em></p>
          <p>
            I lived together with my mom in a old house somewhere in a small
            village surrounded by forrest. The skies where always gloomy and
            grey. It was as if the day was stuck right in the moment before it
            turned from day to dusk.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a pool connected to our house. It was a typical rounded
            plastic pool of the largest kind. The type that you put up
            temporarily during summer. The pool was partially covered by a
            wooden contraption, like a small hosue. Every now and then I had
            caught a glimps of the monster lurking there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every day we had to take a bath in the pool. Other people also used
            the pool, but most never got out. I always got out before the dark
            settled in, but my mother always insisted on staying longer. No
            matter how much I begged her she always stayed behind. Yet she
            always came back.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day I was watching some old videotapes of me and mom. In one
            partucular clip there was a part where something looked strange
            about mom. It was just a bref second, but her eyes seemed to light
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went upstairs to check with her. She was organizing some things
            and her back was facing me. I told her about what I saw and asked
            her to look at me. But she refused. She hid her face from me.I
            grabbed her by the shoulder and tried to get a look at her.
          </p>
          <p>
            The she suddenly stopped fighting and turned towards me. Completely
            still, she looked right at. Her eyes was pitch black and her pupils
            had turned into a bright red color-

            Me and seven other travel companions was on a journey together. We
            had reached a beautiful wooden village floating on a still ocean
            surrounded by mountains in the far distance. The air was free of
            pollution and there was a calm aura encapsulating the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my travel companions, N, met a friend there. His wife was the
            head doctor in the village and he had therefore picked up a few
            things about medical treatment. He loved to do biological
            experiments and had sort of become the village scientist.
          </p>
          <p>
            N wished to consult his friend about a recently developed lump that
            had started growing in his throat. It had started to take the shape
            of a face.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a quick procedure, the scientist managed to safely remove the
            small curiosity. Rather than discarding the lump, he descided to
            nurture it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lump grew quickly and had developed into a plant-like seed about
            the size of a fist. Soon the scientist decided to release it into
            the ocean. The water was pure and provided a nutitious home for the
            seed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seed continued to grow and grow until it bacame a tree so huge
            it towered over the village. The hanging branches fell down to touch
            the water and provided shelter for the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tree was in full bloom. Ginormous pink flowers covered the
            branches. The tree that nearly reached the sky. It could be seen
            from miles away. A fairytale-like view that could only be
            experienced in a dream.

          <p><em>Disclaimer: This one is pretty fucked up 10/10</em></p>
          <p>
            I was going on a trip to Korea together with my friends. The airport
            was far away and we had to travel a great distance to get there. The
            airport had so many floors that we had a hard time trying to find
            our way to the scheduled plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tired and exhausted we eventually found the gate. However, we were
            surprised to see that the plane did in fact no exist. It was all a
            lie and we had been fooled. Even the staff was just holograms that
            all vanished in the blink of an eye. My friends gave up and left to
            go back home. I stayed behind.
          </p>
          <p>I would not accept this fate.</p>
          <p>
            I searched the airport for someone I could talk to and figure out
            what was the reason behind all this. I eventually found the "heart"
            of the airport which was a advanced self driven evil AI system. The
            AI mocked me, and I was all alone. There was nothing I could do.
          </p>
          <p>In that moment, I was filled with blind rage.</p>
          <p>
            I aquired superhuman strenght and went on a rampage, burning down
            everything in my path. Yet I was not satisfied. Tearing down the
            airport was meaningless. I needed to take out my revenge on whoever
            was behind it all.
          </p>
          <p>So I googled the name of the CEO for the airline.</p>
          <p>
            The airline was Norwegian Airlines, and apparently the owner was of
            royal blood. Surrounded by the ruines of the airport left behind
            from me wreaking havoc. I grew to my final demonic form. Wings grew
            from my back and carried me all the way to the hometown of the CEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            He lived in a small cabin in a village far up in the norwegian
            mountain wilderness. I tore the roof off of his house and brought my
            revenge upon him. Blinded by rage I had turned the entire village
            into a living hell, giving birth to such hellish creatures and
            setting everything on fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            After getting my revenge my powers diminished and I was back in my
            human form. Yet, I could still heal faster and was pysically
            stronger any human. But I could not control any of the fire or save
            the tormented souls I had brought into this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation quickly grew out of control. I managed to reunite with
            my familiy and tried my best to help them escape to safety.
