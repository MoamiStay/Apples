          <h3>29.12.21</h3>
          <p>
            I was on a class trip. I'd say we were roughly 15 people. We arrived
            in a old dusty city, brighly lit by golden light. However there was
            no sun for the desert-like city was buried underground. We climbed
            the stairs up an old brick building on the corner. Inside were beds
            and living facilities for us to use. The room looked as if it had
            been decorated by my dear old grandmother. The pillows and bed
            covers was hand knitted in red, green, black and white square
            patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together with my friends we chatted with old classmates in the
            cafeteria.
          </p>
          <p>A day came when I had to run.</p>
          <p>
            A wicked creature had appeared in the city and was wreaking havoc.
            Now, he was chasing me.
          </p>
          <p>It was hunt or be hunted.</p>
          <p>
            I had to fight back. I raced around the city, dashing, flying almost
            teleporting from one place to another. Moving around was easy thanks
            to the city's railing-hook system. But hunting this creature down
            was no easy task. He knew the city inside-out and disappeared just
            as quikly as he had appeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day the disgusting rat had found my family and threathened to
            hurt them. I needed to hurry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wicked rat was as tall as a man and had aquired a native tounge.
            A unpredictable evil drived by nothing but plain wickedness. Worse
            yet, he could take on the form of nearly any other living creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            He led me an old house in the city. The old couple who lived there
            was killed and and he had taken on the form of the husband in order
            to get a jump on me. I was quick enough to dodge his initial attack.
            Now I had to try and fight him off-

          <p>
            Me and seven other travel companions was on a journey together. We
            had reached a beautiful wooden village floating on a still ocean
            surrounded by mountains in the far distance. The air was free of
            pollution and there was a calm aura encapsulating the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my travel companions, N, met a friend there. His wife was the
            head doctor in the village and he had therefore picked up a few
            things about medical treatment. He loved to do biological
            experiments and had sort of become the village scientist.
          </p>
          <p>
            N wished to consult his friend about a recently developed lump that
            had started growing in his throat. It had started to take the shape
            of a face.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a quick procedure, the scientist managed to safely remove the
            small curiosity. Rather than discarding the lump, he descided to
            nurture it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lump grew quickly and had developed into a plant-like seed about
            the size of a fist. Soon the scientist decided to release it into
            the ocean. The water was pure and provided a nutitious home for the
            seed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seed continued to grow and grow until it bacame a tree so huge
            it towered over the village. The hanging branches fell down to touch
            the water and provided shelter for the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tree was in full bloom. Ginormous pink flowers covered the
            branches. The tree that nearly reached the sky. It could be seen
            from miles away. A fairytale-like view that could only be
            experienced in a dream.

          <h3>2021</h3>
          <p><em>Disclaimer: This one is pretty fucked up</em></p>
          <p>
            I was going on a trip to Korea together with my friends. The airport
            was far away and we had to travel a great distance to get there. The
            airport had so many floors that we had a hard time trying to find
            our way to the scheduled plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tired and exhausted we eventually found the gate. However, we were
            surprised to see that the plane did in fact no exist. It was all a
            lie and we had been fooled. Even the staff was just holograms that
            all vanished in the blink of an eye. My friends gave up and left to
            go back home. I stayed behind.
          </p>
          <p>I would not accept this fate.</p>
          <p>
            I searched the airport for someone I could talk to and figure out
            what was the reason behind all this. I eventually found the "heart"
            of the airport which was a advanced self driven evil AI system. The
            AI mocked me, and I was all alone. There was nothing I could do.
          </p>
          <p>In that moment, I was filled with blind rage.</p>
          <p>
            I aquired superhuman strenght and went on a rampage, burning down
            everything in my path. Yet I was not satisfied. Tearing down the
            airport was meaningless. I needed to take out my revenge on whoever
            was behind it all.
          </p>
          <p>So I googled the name of the CEO for the airline.</p>
          <p>
            The airline was Norwegian Airlines, and apparently the owner was of
            royal blood. Surrounded by the ruines of the airport left behind
            from me wreaking havoc. I grew to my final demonic form. Wings grew
            from my back and carried me all the way to the hometown of the CEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            He lived in a small cabin in a village far up in the norwegian
            mountain wilderness. I tore the roof off of his house and brought my
            revenge upon him. Blinded by rage I had turned the entire village
            into a living hell, giving birth to such hellish creatures and
            setting everything on fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            After getting my revenge my powers diminished and I was back in my
            human form. Yet, I could still heal faster and was pysically
            stronger any human. But I could not control any of the fire or save
            the tormented souls I had brought into this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation quickly grew out of control. I managed to reunite with
            my familiy and tried my best to help them escape to safety.
