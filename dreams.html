          <h3>29.12.21</h3>
          <p>
            I was on a class trip. I'd say we were roughly 15 people. We arrived
            in a old dusty city, brighly lit by golden light. However there was
            no sun for the desert-like city was buried underground. We climbed
            the stairs up an old brick building on the corner. Inside were beds
            and living facilities for us to use. The room looked as if it had
            been decorated by my dear old grandmother. The pillows and bed
            covers was hand knitted in red, green, black and white square
            patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together with my friends we chatted with old classmates in the
            cafeteria.
          </p>
          <p>A day came when I had to run.</p>
          <p>
            A wicked creature had appeared in the city and was wreaking havoc.
            Now, he was chasing me.
          </p>
          <p>It was hunt or be hunted.</p>
          <p>
            I had to fight back. I raced around the city, dashing, flying almost
            teleporting from one place to another. Moving around was easy thanks
            to the city's railing-hook system. But hunting this creature down
            was no easy task. He knew the city inside-out and disappeared just
            as quikly as he had appeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day the disgusting rat had found my family and threathened to
            hurt them. I needed to hurry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wicked rat was as tall as a man and had aquired a native tounge.
            A unpredictable evil drived by nothing but plain wickedness. Worse
            yet, he could take on the form of nearly any other living creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            He led me an old house in the city. The old couple who lived there
            was killed and and he had taken on the form of the husband in order
            to get a jump on me. I was quick enough to dodge his initial attack.
            Now I had to try and fight him off-
