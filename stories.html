          <h3>My Kin</h3>
          <p>Norway June 12. 1940</p>
          <p>
            At 6AM sharp a beaming sun ray snuck its way in
            through a small crack in the wooden boards. I observed the boarded up window
            on the far side of the room through heavy eyelids. The sun was
            hard at work finding her way in through every little crack. My eyes were adjusted to the darkness and I could
            make out the silhouettes of the things in my room. Among them
            I noticed a unfamiliar object. </p>
            <p>
            I felt a yawn working its
            way up from my chest. It turned into one of those good yawns that just keeps
            building up and makes your eyes water just a tiny bit.
            As I sat up in my bed the bed springs loudly declared my
            awakened presence. If by any chance someone missed out on the bed spring choir, the squeaking
            floorboards would surely do the job. Considering it was only me and my
            mother, Elanora, living in the house I wasn't worried. Quite frankly, I wasn't
            sure my mother ever slept at all. I couldn't recall seeing her sleep.
            If she did, she'd be the kind to sleep with her eyes open. 
            She had always been paranoid, looking behind her back with every two steps.
            However she wasn't always like this. I remember a time when she was
            a sweet and loving soul. Caring about the people close to her more
            than anything. Her suffering started after what happened on March 21st 1937.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Elmar, my father, he had always been distant to both me and
            Elanora. To be honest I never understood why my mother insisted
            on staying by his side as he practically treated us like strangers.
            It seemed like my fathers interest in us only lessened throughout
            the years. Still Elanora grew ever closer and more dependent on him.
            Perhaps it was just a futile attempt to bring him back.
          </p>
          <p>
            My father was not a likeable man. I would describe him as arrogant.
            The kind of man who was feeding off of his own pride, but in a very
            subtle way. He was a
            man of few words, but his distaste for human kind was a
            recurring theme. And as far as I know, the only real friend he ever
            had was a cat which he even named after himself. Yet he always
            seemed to want to have people around him, and people seemed to be
            oddly drawn to him in a way that I just couldn't explain. Then again, I suppose just because people didn't like him,
            they also didn't hate him. Elmar was an intimidating man, and no one
            really dared to stand up against him. Besides, he never hurt anyone
            or initiated any conflicts. He did, however, suffer from these
            occasional freak-outs. He would just suddenly start frantically
            crying, screaming and begging for some kind of release. Yelling out
            strange words that made no sense to any man. Desperately clinging to
            people around him as if they could help him escape whatever hell he
            was trapped in. Eventually rumors about him suffering from schizophrenia started circulating. He suffered a particularly severe case on March 21.
            1937 that caused him to slice his own neck on the butchers knife. A vivid image of the freshly painted necklace, carved with a knife, still appears when I close my eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creaking floorboards revealed my every step towards the
            bathroom just down the hallway. The sun shined
            through the window and reflected off the old, dusty pictures on the
            walls. With squinted eyes I struggled to adjust to the
            sudden brightness. Nearing the end of the hallway, just as I was about to
            reach for the door handle I heard motorized vehicles approaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped for a moment to peek out the window. They came back again
            today. Just like they did the previous day. Three men stepped out of the car
            and approached our house. I heard three knocks on the door
            downstairs. Just like the previous day. I recognized one of the
            men, the one who seemed to be in charge. It was hard to make out the
            details of his face, but he was a tall and rather good looking man. I heard muffled voices
            downstairs, it seemed like a brief and rather one-sided conversation. The only thing I could make
            sense out of was a <em>"have a nice day ma'am"</em> followed by a
            friendly chuckle. I stood by the window and observed them until they
            had all climbed aboard the vehicle and was on their way. Only
            leaving a dusty trail behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            I proceeded with my usual morning routine, although I decided to
            skip the bath for today.
          </p>
          <p>
            I walked down the creaking staircase that sounded like it was
            all just about to come down. I greeted my mother who sat on a wooden
            chair by the kitchen window. Her ashy brown and grey tinted hair
            swaying from the slight breeze entering through the crack in the
            window. She didn't answer me, instead she continued quietly
            mumbling to herself. The only words I could make out was
            <em>"Elmar"</em> and <em>"child".</em> It wasn't uncommon for her to
            ramble like that. A seemingly never-ending stream of consciousness. She was fixated on one of the houseplants placed in the
            window frame. Her elbows was resting on the table while her skinny
            fingers were busy plucking the leaves off of the plant. She'd pluck away
            all the leaves until only the flowers were left. I never questioned it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "Elmar is almost due, dear. Who will mother your child, dear?
              Who will mother your ugly child?"</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>She sounded spiteful.</p>
          <p><em>-"Hm?"</em></p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "Did you sleep well? No nightmares?"</em
            >
            I told her I had slept well, and that I hadn't had any nightmares. I
            decided not to question the previous line of questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "You aren't feeling sick are you? Doctor Holden just got home
              from his trip. Should I call him to come over and do a check-up on
              you? I have saved some money, so-"</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I cut her off before she could finish, trying to convince her I was
            fine and didn't need any doctors visit. It was always the same.
            Every day I walked into a barrage of questions for a hundred new
            irrational fears and worries from my mother. For someone who was
            this poor at taking care of -and having responsibility for someone, she sure could've fooled me with all
            these questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "There is nothing that has been eating away at you? Nothing
              that's been crawling under your skin?"</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>~~</p>
          <p>
            I opened the fridge and quickly scanned the contents. I shook my
            head in silence. My mother had been out running errands and gone grocery
            shopping the day before, but she had only bought some pickled
            herring for herself and had forgotten about me. I
            glanced over at the bread on the kitchen table. Blue and green
            mold spots had started to form and the sight put a
            quick end to my appetite.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "What's wrong now? You've got to eat something. Where are you
              going? Are you leaving? "</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I halted at the doorstep. On the wall next to me was a photograph of mother and father on their wedding day 24 years
            ago. They both looked so young. It was difficult to tell whether
            they were happy or not. They were staring right into the camera; my
            father with his usual blank, expressionless face and my mother who wore a faint
            smile. I think it was supposed to be a smile anyway. I wondered if
            they had ever been happy together.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at Elanora, she was no longer fixated on the poor
            plant that now only had a few green leaves left hanging. Her light
            grey eyes meeting my hazel ones. Her tired skin and wrinkles
            didn't make her inquisitive gaze any less demanding. Then her eyes
            wandered over to the picture, and her eyes softened.
          </p>
          <p><em>- "I loved him dearly. I miss him so much."</em></p>
          <p>
            She had hardly ever spoken about her relationship with my father. I'm not
            quite sure why, but hearing her say those words angered me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "Why? He didn't care for you <em>or</em> me. He
              never loved you, yet you were too weak to realize it and
              leave."</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "Yes, and I hated him so much for it. I despised every moment
              together with him."</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly there was hatred in her voice.</p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "You aren't making any sense. Why didn't you leave then? Or at the very
              least let me leave?"</em
            >
          </p>
          <p><em>- "If only he had not been taken away from me."</em></p>
          <p>
            She whimpered, and her eyes started to water. I decided to end the
            conversation there as I figured It wasn't gonna make me any more
            wiser.
          </p>
          <p>My stomach growled. My appetite had slowly been creeping back.</p>
          <p><em>- "There is no food. I'll just go get some bread and-"</em></p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "There is food in the fridge and
              bread on the table. Don't try to make excuses to leave the
              house!"</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "The bread is moldy and I do not eat pickled herring. You know
              that, right?"</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Elanora then slowly looked over at the bench with a slightly
            concerned look on her face. "Oh" she said quietly to herself as she
            turned back around to face the houseplant. She tore off the last few
            remaining leaves. Then she reached her hand out towards it and let
            her thumb carefully stroke the flower. Just as she was about
            to get up from the chair I spoke.
          </p>
          <p><em>- "Why not let me go buy what we ne-"</em></p>
          <p>
            <em
              >- "NO! no, I'll do it. You will stay home. Do the laundry if
              you're restless."</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I hated living here. I hated living with her. She never let me leave
            the house or talk to anyone and it had only gotten worse since the
            war broke out. I didn't even know if I had any
            other relatives left. I had tried to ask about them, but my mother
            wouldn't talk. As far as I knew she was the only family I had.
          </p>
          <p>
            I watched as my mother dragged her tired feet across the floor and
            headed towards the door. I sat down beside the kitchen table where she had been sitting and looked out the window. The
            sun had now been taken prisoner by a group of clouds, putting a grey filter on
            the world outside. The leaves on the big oak tree in the
            backyard was swaying in the light breeze. A couple
            sparrows flew in with sticks, grass and straws for their nest.
            I let my mind wander off. Suddenly a black raven came out of nowhere and landed right
            outside of the window, startling me. I flinched back in my seat and
            watched it with wide eyes. I flinched again as it pecked on the
            glass to try to get to the bread crumbs that was spilled on the
            table. The raven seemed to realize it was futile and let out a caw.
            It's head turning from side to side, it had noticed my presence and
            was now observing me through the window. The raven cawed one last
            time before taking off. The sound of the front door closing
            simultaneously. I leaned back in my chair and let out a sigh. I
            closed my eyes as I slowly rocked back
            and forth for a moment. Letting my mind wander off.
          </p>

            <em
              >Blood came trickling down around my feet. The left arm was
              dislocated and twisted behind the shoulder. Pools of blood started
              to form around me. One leg was torn off by the kneecap while the
              other was shattered from the knee to the foot. The road was now
              painted in a crimson red. Her face was no longer recognizable.
              One eyeball popping out of the skull, while the other eye that was
              still intact was fixated on mine. Even though the jaw was broken
              and barely intact, there were sounds escaping her mouth. None that
              could be made out as words.</em
