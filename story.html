          </div>
          <h2>I am a Liar</h2>
          <p>I’ve always considered myself a very honest person. Partially because I also do consider myself a terrible liar. I would rather tell the hard truth than getting caught in a lie. You can ask me personal questions, and I don’t mind answering. In fact, I like talking about myself (as most people do). <em>But ONLY when the other person askes out of genuine interest, and not just simple courtesy.</em> I love when people start a sentence with “Can I ask you a personal question?”. Probably because I just can’t stand small-talk and meaningless “filler” conversations. I’d rather just enjoy the silence then.  Let’s talk about something deep. Something <em>meaningful</em>. Even if it is at the cost of my precious privacy. </p>
          <p>But this isn’t always the case. I will lie, or at least try my best to avoid mentioning stuff about myself that will make other people worried about me. </p>
          <p>I recently talked to my friend. The last time we met I opened up about some struggles I had been dealing with. I think that was the first time I had ever shared my personal struggles with someone else. And now, a few months later, she asked me about it. She wanted an “update”. <em>“Are you doing alright?”</em>, <em>“You know the thing you said..”</em>.</p>
          <p> Initially I was surprised by the question since I had completely forgotten that I had told her in the first place. And then I just felt bothered by it. It’s <em>my</em> problem so leave it to <em>me</em>. I didn't tell you so you could come and ask me about it again later. <em>How dare you try to be a good, supportive friend! This is not what I signed up for!</em> So I just avoided that whole conversation by answering something like.. <em>“yeeah.. I mean. Yeah. I’m ok. Like… It’s whatever. I mean, I’m fine. Really. It’s not that big of a deal. I’m not that bothered by it.”</em> </p>
          <p>Smooth.</p>
          <p>I know myself well enough to know why I am like this. It’s because 1. I don’t like showing my weaknesses. It makes me feel vulnerable. And 2. Because I don’t want other people to worry about me. So in short; There is a good chance I’ll lie if you ask me to share anything that makes me seem like a weakli- ..uh-Human! I mean human. I don’t like being human. Don’t make me feel like a human. I am in fact a stone with a face drawn on it. You can talk to the stone. The stone will sit there and listen to you. But don’t ask the stone how it’s feeling. Because stones don’t talk, especially not about feelings. </p>
          <p>What else do I lie about? Weeell.. </p>
          <p><em>“How was the party last night? Fun?” - “Yeah, it was fun”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Isn’t it nice being back home?” – “Yeah, it’s nice”</em></p>
          <p><em>“It’s gonna be fun going out tonight!” – “Yeah, sure”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Oh hi, where have you been?” – “Oh just hanging out with some friends...”</em></p>
          <p><em>“How do you feel?” – “I’m good”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Do you wanna hang out today?” – “Yeah totally!” </em></p>
          <p><em>“Sorry, but I really gotta leave. It must be boring for you to stay here all by yourself.” – “Oh, yeah. Sure, it does get a bit boring sometimes.”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Do you want dessert?” – “Um.. yeah, sure.”</em></p>
          <p>Reading this might make you think: <em>“Oh she just really likes being alone, huh?”.</em></p>
          <p>No. I don’t <em>like</em> being alone. I <em>LOVE</em> being alone. Best fucking thing in the world. To me there is no better company than simply me, myself and I. (Don’t worry I do enjoy talking to other people too. Just in moderate amounts). </p>
          <p>Why do I lie? Kinda obvious, isn’t it? <em>When the honest answer is not the expected one, the other person will be concerned.</em> Which I don’t like. Especially since to me there is nothing worrisome about being alone. Isolation is often what I seek and find ideal. </p>

            ">
          </div>
          <h2>Obsessed with myself</h2>
          <p>I have never loved being me, but I sure love being with myself.</p>
          <p>
            It’s no secret I’m an introvert. But sometimes I wonder how much of
            my self-isolation can be excused by that, and how much might be due
            to some other underlying reason(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have never been the type to initiate get-togethers with friends,
            or go for spontaneous visits, or ask people over, or contact people
            I haven’t talked to in forever… I can easily spend a week alone and
            still be annoyed by a single phone-call or even just answering a
            message could be bothersome. After two weeks I might start to feel
            somewhat guilty, but not enough to do anything about it. After three
            weeks is usually when the societal pressure of simply having to
            exist gets to me, and I might contact someone. So really, I still
            only contact someone because I feel like I “should", rather than actual interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where things get a bit awkward. Because generally,
            <em>healthy</em> introverts still likes to hang out with people every now and then. Just
            not to the same extent as our counterparts, the extroverts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes just the idea of having to leaving my safe haven and seeing someone
            is enough to send me into a blanket-burrito-chanting-“I don’t
            want to go. I don’t exist”- kind of state.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not that I dislike other people. It’s just that I find being in
            my own company the more appealing option. Probably rooted in comfort
            since I always feel some level of discomfort being around others. My
            body is constantly tensed up and I view myself through the eyes of
            others but thinking they judge me as hard as I do myself.
            #JustSocialAnxietyThings?
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of what makes it so draining for me to be around others is that
            I hate the person I become. Sure, everyone changes and “filters”
            themselves depending on the group they’re with, but to me I don’t
            feel like myself at all. It’s basically “me” except you strip away
            nearly everything that makes me “me”. I get tired from keeping up a
            façade, almost turning myself into a stranger. Locking away most
            parts of myself. This is most likely rooted in some kind of childhood-trauma that triggered something in me to make me feel like it's not okay to express certain sides of myself. Perhaps due to the lack of common interests within the core familiy I felt alienated. <em>I shouldn't talk about my interests because they won't understand it anyway.</em> Just speculating.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a bad habit of assuming everyone else thinks everything
            I like is stupid. And therefore I rarely open up about my interests
            or talk about myself. Because I see my interests as an extension of
            myself, and if you disapprove or say <em>“I don’t get it”</em> I
            take that shit personally, and it hurts.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I subtly reveal my interests, it is my attempt at connecting with
            someone. If I comfortably share my interests, it means I really like
            you and you are a special person to me =)
          </p>
          <p>
            Being left in my own space gives me freedom from all of this. There
            is no judgment, and I can indulge in whatever I want.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I say that I wish I could express myself comfortably around
            anyone and be myself wherever I am...
          </p>
          <p>
            You might want to say “Ok, but then just share what you like! Tell
            me about it. I’ll listen. Practice is all you need!”
          </p>
          <p>
            I appreciate the thoughtfullness. But No. All that does is putting more pressure on me and it makes me
            more hesitant to open up. <em>Don't put me on the spot, please.</em> Just keep
            my words in mind and <u>listen</u> <em>when</em> and <em>if</em> I choose to open
            up.

          <div class="container">
            <img src="images/home/7.png">
          </div>
          <h2>Kpop changed my life?</h2>
          <p>That is not a title I'd ever thought I'd write.</p>
          <p>But yes. Kpop <em>did</em> change my life.</p>
          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>
            Well.. Just like many others, my first introduction to K-pop was
            when Gangnam Style took the world by storm back in 2012. Did I think
            "This is it.. this is what I've been missing in my life!"? nope. Not
            at all. The song was hella catchy though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember watching some "youtubers reacts: K-pop" videos, and also
            finding K-pop refrences in League of Legends which I was into at the
            time. I found some songs catchy but I was still not convinced.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't until summer 2018 when I came across a video of
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbkPSvoiYfg&ab_channel=ComeGetPsalm"
              >BoxBox dancing to Likey by Twice</a
            >
            that I started looking more into the music. I had heard about this
            one group called BTS. <em>"What did BTS even stand for? Beats?"</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't lie. Initially I didn't like it. I kept their music on
            shuffle for a while but it wasn't really my cup'o tea. But then
            again... I never particularly liked Pop or Hip-Hop music. I'd rather
            stick to my Heavy Metal and Swedish Dance-bands thank you very much.
          </p>
          <p>I can clearly remember my "Turning Point".</p>
          <p>
            I came across
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PN81zxytPs&ab_channel=Joey%28LuckyBoy%29Nato"
              >this</a
            >
            video. I'm pretty sure it was the first Reaction Video I ever
            watched. It's just a breakdown of BTS's song MicDrop from the
            perspective of a music producer. I found the video very interesting
            and it somehow "rewired" my brain to understand and appreciate this
            kind of music in a way I never had before.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was pretty much the nail in the coffin for me. After that I
            found the music increasingly enjoyable. And my music taste took a
            180 degree turn from that point on.
          </p>

          <h3>What about it was it that helped me?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't exactly remember when I started feeling sad. Probably some
            time around 2017 I think. I felt pretty miserable but I couldn't
            find the motivation or willpower to do, well.. anything.
          </p>
          <p>And then.. I discovered K-pop. And I'm really glad I did.</p>
          <p>I'm pretty sure that just the change of music-genre itself was enough to help me somewhat. Previously I was mostly listening to sad and angry music, which probably only fueled my own feeling rooted in those emotions. When listening to Kpop I got a lot more exposure to music with positive messages, and happy feelings. Listen to a sad song, and you will feel sad. Listen to a happy song, and you will feel happy. Who should've known?...</p>
          <p>
            But there is a lot more to it than just "Good Vibes~~". I had never really had any interest in public figures. Celebrities
            and all that... I couldn't care less honestly. But for some reason I
            decided to look into this Korean Boyband. Mostly just for fun,
            almost in a mocking way. You know.. the typical
            <em>"They all look the same, how can you even tell them apart?"</em>
            type of thing that a lot of people would say. I guess I just wanted
            to challenge myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jokes on me though, because before I knew it I could easily list up
            all of their names (Stagenames, real names and nicknames), their
            birthdays and even the names of their pets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes. K-pop is a huge corporate business, these artists who are
            "owned" by money-hungry companies that do anything to draw people in
            and make them "addicted".
          </p>
          <p>But.</p>
          <p>Hear me out!</p>
          <p>
            There was just something about these people. They just seemed so
            genuine and down to earth. They were relatable. They were so
            transparent with their fans, as well as respectable artists. They seemed like hard-working, humble people who tried to make the most out of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            From talking about their personal experiences with depression and
            hardships, to promoting selv-love through their music. The honesty
            and "realness" that they showed was part of what really drew me in.
            However, more than anything, more than the music, it was the
            relationship between them that had the biggest effect on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing these people being happy. Seeing the closely knittet
            friendship between them. It was everything I felt like I was lacking
            and missing in my own life. It made me feel less lonely. I found
            myself smiling and laughing while watching their content. Sure, I
            did feel stupid at times for giggling at all these silly things. But at least
            I felt happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also the huge community that comes with it all. The fandom
            gets A LOT of shit, and many think of us "K-pop Stans" and crazy,
            delusional 12 year olds that can't take any form of critisism.
            (Which sometimes do be the case..). But for the most part people are
            pretty cool. I was part of a community where I got to know a few
            people that I considered good and supportive friends for a while.
          </p>

          <h3>How did I change?</h3>
          <p>
            Not only did I change, but I also realized quite a few things about
            myself thanks to K-pop. Particularly in regard to my taste in men.
            (Like men in flashy haircolors, makeup and crop-tops is honestly
            kinda hot..)
          </p>

          <p>But on a more serious note..</p>
          <p>
            I feel like I've become more open minded and accepting. And I also
            realized I still got a long way to go in regards to being more open
            minded and accepting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also experienced a new-found appreciation for life. And I started
            to feel like I needed to do something. I needed to make an effort to
            stop wasting my life away like I had been doing for the past few
            years. I wanted to start taking better care of myself. I realized
            that I was in full control of my own life and I could do anything I
            wanted to. I wanted to experience more independence. I wanted to
            challenge myself to do something bold and crazy. To prove to myself
            that "I can do anything!". The relationship I was in at the time did
            nothing for me, and I finally realized that I deserved better.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what led to me to move to Korea the following year. I wanted
            to escape everything. To go somewhere where no one could reach me.
            Challenging myself to learn a new language and adapt to a new
            culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still not at all satisfied with my life. But now I'm finally in a
            state where I feel like I'm strong enough to put in some effort to
            make improvements. And K-pop is what gave me the initial push to help me help myself.
          </p>
          <h3>Some drawbacks..</h3>
          <p>
            There is no doubt that this has had an positive influence on my
            life. However, there's always a price to pay. Currently the biggest
            concern I have is the amount of time I spend on consuming K-content. I really don't want to use the word "addicted" but..

            Sometimes I do priorotize these "fake" relationships over real ones.
            And that seems kind of counterintuitive to everything else I mentioned
            earlier, right?

            Another thing is money. I don't really spend money on anything else
            so I feel like it's not a big issue. But one can definetively end up
            spending way too much money on this if not careful.
