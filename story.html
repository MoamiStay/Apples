          <h2>Kpop changed my life?</h2>
          <p>That is not a title I'd every thought I'd write.</p>
          <p>But yes. Kpop <em>did</em> change my life.</p>
          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>
            Well.. Just like many others, my first introduction to K-pop was
            when Gangnam Style took the world by storm back in 2012. Did I think
            "This is it.. this is what I've been missing in my life!"? nope. Not
            at all. The song was hella catchy though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember watching some "youtubers reacts: K-pop" videos, and also
            finding K-pop refrences in League of Legends which I was into at the
            time. I found some songs catchy but I was still not convinced.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't until summer 2018 when I came across a video of
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbkPSvoiYfg&ab_channel=ComeGetPsalm"
              >BoxBox dancing to Likey by Twice</a
            >
            that I started looking more into the music. I had heard about this
            one group called BTS. <em>"What did BTS even stand for? Beats?"</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't lie. Initially I didn't like it. I kept their music on
            shuffle for Ã¥ while but it wasn't really my cup'o tea. But then
            again... I never particularly liked Pop or Hip-Hop music. I'd rather
            stick to my Heavy Metal and Swedish Dance-bands thank you very much.
          </p>
          <p>I can clearly remember my "Turning Point".</p>
          <p>
            I came across
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PN81zxytPs&ab_channel=Joey%28LuckyBoy%29Nato"
              >this</a
            >
            video. I'm pretty sure it was the first Reaction Video I ever
            watched. It's just a breakdown of BTS's song MicDrop from the
            perspective of a music producer. I found the video very interesting
            and it somehow "rewired" my brain to understand and appreciate this
            kind of music in a way I never had before.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was pretty much the nail in the coffin for me. After that I
            found the music increasingly enjoyable. And my music taste took a
            180 degree turn from that point on.
          </p>

          <h3>What about it was it that helped me?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't exactly remember when I started feeling sad. Probably some
            time around 2017 I think. I felt pretty miserable but I couldn't
            find the motivation or willpower to do, well.. anything.
          </p>
          <p>And then.. I discovered K-pop. And I'm really glad I did.</p>
          <p>
            I have never really had any interest in public figures. Celebrities
            and all that... I couldn't care less honestly. But for some reason I
            decided to look into this Korean Boyband. Mostly just for fun,
            almost in a mocking way. You know.. the typical
            <em>"They all look the same, how can you even tell them apart?"</em>
            type of thing that a lot of people would say. I guess I just wanted
            to challenge myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jokes on me though, because before I knew it I could easily list up
            all of their names (Stagenames, real names and nicknames), their
            birthdays and even the names of their pets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes. K-pop is a huge corporate business, these artists who are
            "owned" by money-hungry companies that do anything to draw people in
            and make us "addicted".
          </p>
          <p>But.</p>
          <p>Hear me out!</p>
          <p>
            There was just something about these people. They just seemed so
            genuine and down to earth. They were relatable. They were so
            transparent with their fans. As well as respectable artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            From talking about their personal experiences with depression and
            hardships, to promoting selv-love through their music. The honesty
            and "realness" that they showed was part of what really drew me in.
            However, more than anything, more than the music, it was the
            relationship between them that had the biggest effect on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing these people being happy. Seeing the closely knittet
            friendship between them. It was everything I felt like I was lacking
            and missing in my own life. It made me feel less lonely. I found
            myself smiling and laughing while watching their content. Sure, I
            did feel stupid at times for giggling at all these silly things. But
            I felt happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also the huge community that comes with it all. The fandom
            gets A LOT of shit, and many think of us "K-pop Stans" and crazy,
            delusional 12y year olds that can't take any form of critisism.
            (Which sometimes do be the case..). But for the most part people are
            pretty cool. I was part of a community where I got to know a few
            people that I considered good friends for a while.
          </p>

          <h3>How did I change?</h3>
          <p>
            Not only did I change, but I also realized quite a few things about
            myself thanks to K-pop. Particularly in regard to my taste in men.
            (Like men in flashy haircolors, makeup and crop-tops is honestly
            kinda hot..)
          </p>

          <p>But on a more serious note..</p>
          <p>
            I feel like I've become more open minded and accepting. And I also
            realized I still got a long way to go in regards to being more open
            minded and accepting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also experienced a new-found appreciation for life. And I started
            to feel like I needed to do something. I needed to make an effort to
            stop wasting my life away like I had been doing for the past few
            years. I wanted to start taking better care of myself. I realized
            that I was in full control of my own life and I could do anything I
            wanted to. I wanted to experience more independence. I wanted to
            challenge myself to do something bold and crazy. To prove to myself
            that "I can do anything!". The relationship I was in at the time did
            nothing for me, and I finally realized that I deserved better.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what led to me to move to Korea the following year. I wanted
            to escape everything. To go somewhere where no one could reach me.
            Challenging myself to learn a new language and adapt to a new
            culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still not at all satisfied with my life. But now I'm finally in a
            state where I feel like I'm strong enough to put in some effort to
            make improvements.
          </p>
          <h3>Some drawbacks..</h3>
          <p>
            There is no doubt that this has had an positive influence on my
            life. However, there's always a price to pay. Currently the biggest
            concern I have is the amount of time I spend on consuming K-pop
            content. I really don't want to use the word "addicted" but..
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes I do priorotize these "fake" relationships over real ones.
            That seems kind of counterintuitive to everything else I mentioned
            earlier, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing is money. I don't really spend money on anything else
            so I feel like it's not a big issue. But one can definetively end up
            spending way too much money on this if not careful.
