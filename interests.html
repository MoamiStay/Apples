          <h2>Spider Pets</h2>
          <p>
            Lately I stumbled across a Youtube chanel called
            <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ExoticsLair"
              >Exotics Lair</a
            >. There was a few days where I watched his videos non-stop. I found
            the Unboxing videos particularly entertaining. Seeing all the
            different spiders and their unique tempers and personalities was
            enough to have me make up my mind. I wanted one.
          </p>
          <p>But which one? There are so many to choose from..</p>
          <p>
            Looking up videos on beginner-friendly tarantulas and being
            introduced to more species, I eventually landed on the Brazilian
            Black Tarantula. There was just something about the all-black
            tarantula that I really liked.
          </p>
          <p>However..</p>
          <p>
            A little while later I stumbled across the Velvet Spiders. I found
            these little guys so cute and I would love to have one myself!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly they are somewhat uncommon and can be hard to get a hold of.
            They don't burrow and live for around 5 years.
          </p>
          <p>but of course.. There is more. JUMPING SPIDERS!</p>
          <p>These guys are soooo so cute and I reeeeeally really want one!</p>
          <p>
            They are small and well.. jumpy. Compared to other spiders they are
            really active and have a lot of personality! They make for more
            exciting pets than most other spider that are usually more docile.
            They are easy to care for and fairly common. Sadly they only live
            around 1 year.
